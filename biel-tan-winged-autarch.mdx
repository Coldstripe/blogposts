This is one of my favorite models that I've painted so far. I really enjoy how the power sword turned out.

Painting white can be tough, but Apothecary White contrast paint from Citadel was a big help for this project.

If you're wondering about the technique for the power sword, check out this tutorial by **Luminous Figure Painters**.
